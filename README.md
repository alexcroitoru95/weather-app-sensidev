weatherApp

Short description:
weatherApp is a simple and fast way to find out how the weather is in your city. All you have to do is enter your city name or id and an interactive chart will show you how the weather will be for the next 5 days. Also, you have the option to view historical data (including lowest, average and maximum values) for the past 5 days. Enjoy :D

Challenges:
-History section was one of the hardest parts due to the fact that Weatherbit only allows 1 day of data per API call for free subscriptions.
-Unit testing ( never worked with Jasmine before :) )

Work time: 24h
